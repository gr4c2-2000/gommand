```sh
make build_activate-window
```

## Using activate-window

To use activate-window add a keyboard shortcut on a system level for example :https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/keyboard-shortcuts-set.html.en
as command use fullpath to executable with the name of app that you wanna rotate, for example:

```sh
path/to/the/repo/bin/activate-window code
```

this will rotate focus/ontop app window between all open visual studio code instances.
